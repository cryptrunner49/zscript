## How to Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to the ZScript project:

- **Report Bugs**: Identify and report issues with the language or examples.
- **Suggest Features**: Propose new language features, native functions, or example scripts.
- **Improve Documentation**: Enhance the `ZSCRIPT_USAGE.MD`, this file, or add new guides.
- **Submit Code**: Add new `.z` example scripts, fix bugs, or improve the interpreter (if applicable).

All contributions should align with the project‚Äôs goal of making ZScript a simple, expressive, and Unicode-friendly scripting language.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Search the [Issues](https://github.com/cryptrunner49/zscript/issues) tab to avoid duplicates.
2. **Open a New Issue**:
   - Provide a clear title (e.g., "Runtime Error in `for` Loop with Unicode Variables").
   - Include:
     - A description of the issue.
     - Steps to reproduce (e.g., a minimal `.z` script).
     - Expected vs. actual behavior.
     - ZScript version (if known) and environment (e.g., OS).
   - Example:

     ```text
     **Title**: Runtime Error: String Comparison in Loop
     **Description**: Using `>` with strings causes an error.
     **Steps**: Run `var a = "1"; println(a > "2");`
     **Expected**: False
     **Actual**: Runtime Error: Both operands must be numbers
     **Environment**: ZScript vX.X, Windows 10
     ```

3. **Label**: Add the `bug` label to help us triage.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea for a new feature or improvement?

1. **Check Existing Suggestions**: Look in [Issues](https://github.com/cryptrunner49/zscript/issues) for similar proposals.
2. **Open a New Issue**:
   - Use the "Feature Request" template (if available).
   - Provide:
     - A clear title (e.g., "Add Array Slicing Syntax").
     - A detailed description of the feature.
     - Use case or example code.
     - Potential benefits (e.g., improved readability).
   - Example:

     ```text
     **Title**: Add Array Slicing Syntax
     **Description**: Support `arr[start:end]` for slicing arrays.
     **Example**: `var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]; println(arr[1:3]); // Outputs: [2, 3]`
     **Benefits**: Simplifies array manipulation, aligns with other languages.
     ```

3. **Label**: Add the `enhancement` label.

## Submitting Code Changes

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click "Fork" on [GitHub](https://github.com/cryptrunner49/zscript) to create your copy.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git`
3. **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b <branch-name>` (e.g., `git checkout -b add-array-slicing`)
4. **Make Changes**: Edit files locally (e.g., add `.z` scripts or modify the ZScript VM).
5. **Test**: Run your changes with the ZScript VM to ensure they work as expected.

### Code Style Guidelines

For `.z` scripts:

- **Section Headers**: Use `// --- Section Name ---` and `println("--- Section Name ---");` for organization (see `ZSCRIPT_USAGE.MD`).
- **Print Statements**: Include descriptive labels (e.g., `println("Result:", value);`).
- **Spacing**: Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces) and line breaks for readability.
- **Comments**: Add brief comments for complex logic (e.g., `// Base case for recursion`).
- **Naming**: Use meaningful names; Unicode/emoji names are encouraged where thematic (e.g., `üê±` for cat-related examples).

For Compiler and VM code:

- Follow the Go style conventions (e.g., use gofmt for formatting).
- Document new functions with comments.
- Ensure that comments are clear and provide context for the functionality.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Commit Changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "Add array slicing example in arrays.z"`
   - Use clear, concise commit messages (e.g., "Fix bug in string comparison", "Update README with modules").
2. **Push to Your Fork**: `git push origin <branch-name>`
3. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request".
   - Select your branch and compare it to the main branch.
   - Provide:
     - A title (e.g., "Add Array Slicing Example").
     - A description:
       - What you changed.
       - Why (e.g., fixes issue #123).
       - How to test (e.g., "Run `arrays.z`").
   - Example:

     ```text
     **Title**: Add Array Slicing Example
     **Description**: Added slicing demo to `arrays.z`. Resolves #45.
     **Changes**: Updated `arrays.z` with `arr[1:3]` example.
     **Test**: Run `seed arrays.z` and check output: `[2, 3]`.
     ```

4. **Label**: Add `enhancement`, `bug`, or `documentation` as appropriate.
5. **Review**: Respond to feedback from maintainers.
