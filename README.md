# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è SPYScript - Slim PY Script

SPYScript is a lightweight, expressive scripting language designed for simplicity and flexibility. With support for Unicode and emoji identifiers, native functions, and modern programming constructs, SPYScript is perfect for quick scripts, educational purposes, or experimenting with creative coding. Whether you're shuffling arrays, writing to files, or defining structs with cat emojis (üê±), SPYScript makes programming fun and accessible.

## Features

- **Unicode & Emoji Support**: Use `œÄ`, `Êå®Êã∂`, or `üî¢` as variable names.
- **Simple Syntax**: Easy-to-learn constructs like `var`, `fn`, `if`, and `for`.
- **Native Functions**: Built-ins like `clock()`, `shuffle()`, and `random_between()`.
- **Structs & Closures**: Define custom types and leverage functional programming.
- **File I/O**: Read and write files with `read_file()` and `write_file()`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any system with the required dependencies.

## Installation

### Requirements

To build and run the SPYScript VM, you‚Äôll need:

```text
- Go (golang)
- libffi
- readline
- gcc
- pkg-config
```

#### Install Requirements on Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang libffi-dev libreadline-dev gcc pkg-config
```

#### Install Requirements on macOS

```bash
brew install go libffi readline pkg-config
```

### Building SPYScript VM

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cryptrunner49/goseedvm.git
   cd goseedvm
   ```

2. Build the interpreter:

   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. Run a script:

   ```bash
   ./bin/seed scripts/rpg.spy
   ```

## Usage

Try this simple example:

```seed
var Êå®Êã∂ = "Hello, SPYScript!";
println(Êå®Êã∂);  // Outputs: Hello, SPYScript!

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) {
    println("Count:", i);  // Outputs: Count: 0, Count: 1, Count: 2
}
```

## Roadmap

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs planned for SPYScript‚Äôs future:

- [ ] **Pattern Matching**: Add expressive pattern matching for conditionals.
- [ ] **Switch Case**: Implement a `switch` statement for multi-branch logic.
- [ ] **Elif**: Extend `if` with `elif` for cleaner conditional chains.
- [ ] **Enums**: Introduce enumerated types for structured data.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add try-catch or similar mechanisms.
- [ ] **Standard Library**: Expand with more utility functions.
